These lists came to life due to a personal need and should not be used by you. They are also extremely biased. If you use these lists you _will_ block stuff you might want.

If you're looking for blocklists that are updated regularly and are not biased and useful, then check out these lists:
- [Firebog](https://firebog.net/)
- [StevenBlack](https://github.com/StevenBlack/hosts)

They actually put work and effort in, so this should be your place to start, not my own list that I automatically update with scripts based on theirs.

Thanks for understanding
